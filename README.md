# react-native-spinner-button
This is a pure javascript and react-native Button component with a Spinner embeded in it.
In many of the react-native projects we have worked on required the button to be disabled when app is processing something on tap of that button, and a loading indicator on it or beside it, so the user can be made aware of app doing some processing.

From a developer perspective, it is very painful to manage two different components: a button and a spinner for lots of buttons! So when we came accross this beautiful component [SSspinnerButton](https://github.com/simformsolutions/SSSpinnerButton), we decided to do something like that in react-native.

By default it will render a Button and you have to pass a boolean _isLoading_ prop to it. When the _isLoading_ will be true, it will render a Spinner in place of the Button and once its false, the Button will be rendered back again.

## Features
* Drop in replacement for a button and indicator combo
* Very easy to use
* Pure javscript component
* Consistent look and feel on both iOS and Android
* Any spinner from [react-native-indicators](https://github.com/n4kz/react-native-indicators) can be used with most of its properties
* The animations _fadeIn_, _flipInX_ and _flipInY_ can be used from [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable)
* Give any style to your button

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i react-native-spinner-button --save
```

## Usage
```javascript
import SpinnerButton from 'react-native-spinner-button';
...
// Your button component
  <SpinnerButton
    buttonStyle={styles.buttonStyle}
    isLoading={this.state.defaultLoading}
    onPress={() => {
      this.setState({ defaultLoading: true });
    }}
    indicatorCount={10}
  >
    <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Default Or Ball SpinnerButton</Text>
  </SpinnerButton>
```
Don't forget to set the state variable you have given to _isLoading_ prop false when processing is done for the button tap.

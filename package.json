  "description": "This is a react-native button component with a spinner. You can load a spinner or a button from the same component depending on a flag. for eg, you have a button. And on press of that button you are doing something and wants the user to show a spinner, all you have to do is use this component. You can pass along a boolean flag. The component will render a spinner if the flag is true and button if the flag is false.",
